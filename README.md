Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a technical writer documenting cloud-based software at Blackbaud to help power the social good community. I have a passion for learning, knowledge sharing, collaboration, and working with new technologies. Lately, I've been focused on creating SPAs, using the Docs as Code approach, and writing developer docs.

Outside of work, I like to play guitar and listen to all types of music. My current Spotify playlists include a lot of Allman Betts Band, Dead and Company, Marc Ford, Allman Brothers Band, Black Crowes, and other southern rock and jam bands.

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Staff Technical Writer documenting DevSecOps software at [Harness](harness.io). You can view my contributions to the Harness Developer Hub [here](https://github.com/brian-f-harness). 

I have a passion for continuous learning, sharing knowledge, collaborating across teams, and working with new technologies. Recently, I've focused on using the Docs as Code approach, creating developer docs, and learning about the Harness Platform and Self-Managed Enterprise Edition.

-  Hey! ðŸ‘‹
-  I am a technical writer based in Summerville, South Carolina. I document cloud-based software Blackbaud to help power the social good community. I have a passion for learning, knowledge sharing, and new technologies. I'm interested in SPAs, Docs as Code approach, and guitar. ðŸ‘€
-  Right now, I can't get enough Allman Betts Band and Dead and Company.
